## About This Wiki

This wiki compares and contrasts the benefits of these two  energy sectors: oil and gas operations and renewable energy operations. We take it upon ourselves to weigh out the pros and cons of each type of energy and how beneficial it would be for us. Our analysis will focus on the efficiency of these two sectors, the operational cost of these sources, and the infrastructure that allows us to build it as such. We aim to create a better understanding of this sector using our data science experience as a framework to provide a deeper look into these sectors.


## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure you have either Anaconda or Miniconda installed. If not, you can download and install Miniconda from this [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).
   - Ensure that **VS Code** is installed with the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions enabled.  

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code, then open the terminal by going to **View > Terminal** or pressing `Ctrl + ` ` (backtick).
   - Clone the repository by running the following commands:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/busi732/Team1-F24-BUSI732.git
     cd Team1-F24-BUSI732
     ```

## Setting Up the Environment

The project uses Conda for managing dependencies. You’ll set up the environment using the `environment.yml` file, which includes all required packages.

1. **Create the Conda Environment**:
   - Run the following command in the terminal to create the environment:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     ```
   - This command will create a new Conda environment called `wind_turbine_env` with the dependencies listed in `environment.yml`.

2. **Activate the Environment**:
   - After creating the environment, activate it with:
     ```bash
     conda activate 732_turbine_env
     ```

3. **Add the Environment to Jupyter**:
   - To ensure that the environment is available as a kernel in Jupyter notebooks, run:
     ```bash
     python -m ipykernel install --user --name=732_turbine_env --display-name "Python (732_turbine_env)"
     ```

## Selecting the Conda Environment in VS Code

After setting up the Conda environment, follow these steps to select it in VS Code:

1. **Open a Jupyter Notebook**:
   - In VS Code, navigate to `notebooks/mytests/check_conda.ipynb` or any other notebook in the project.

2. **Open the Kernel Selector**:
   - At the top right of the notebook, you’ll see a kernel selector (or a prompt asking you to select a kernel). Click on it to open the environment selection dropdown.

3. **Choose the Correct Environment**:
   - In the list, look for `732_turbine_env` with the specified Python version (e.g., `Python 3.8.x`). It should appear under **Conda Env**.
   - Click on `732_turbine_env` to select it as the active environment for the notebook.

4. **Verify the Selection**:
   - Once selected, you should see "732_turbine_env (Python 3.8.x)" displayed at the top of the notebook. This confirms that the notebook is using the correct Conda environment.

## Running the Project

1. **Run Cells**:
   - Run individual cells in the notebook. Verify that each cell executes successfully to confirm that your environment is set up correctly.

## Contributing to the Project

To contribute, you may need to add new packages or update existing ones in the environment. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Installing Packages**:
   - Once the environment is activated, you can install additional packages as needed using either conda or pip:
     ```bash
     conda install <package-name>
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     pip install <package_name>
     ```
     for example:
     ```bash
     conda install numpy pandas
     pip install requests
     ```
2. **Update Environment**
   - It’s a good idea to periodically run:
     ```bash
     conda update --all
     ```
     This keeps all packages up to date and avoids compatibility issues.
     
     > **Note**: Running `conda update --all` does not automatically update the `environment.yml` file. After updating packages, you need to manually update the environment file.
     
   - To update the `environment.yml` file with this change, export the current environment:
     ```bash
     conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
     ```
     > **Note**: `--from-history` includes only the packages you explicitly installed, which keeps `environment.yml` clean and avoids unnecessary dependencies.

     > ⚠️ **Important:** Please make sure the conda-forge is still under the channels section, if it is not, add it back to the first line under the channels section.
     
     > ⚠️ **Important:** Remove the last prefix line if it exists.

3. **Merging Updates**:
   - After updating `environment.yml` or pull the latest changes from the repository (including an updated `environment.yml`). you need to update the local environment to match the new configuration:
     ```bash
     conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
     ```
     This will update your environment to match the `environment.yml` file, adding or removing packages as needed.
     
     > **Note**: The `--prune` flag ensures any packages removed from the environment are also removed locally, keeping everyone’s environment consistent.

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - When you’ve made changes to the environment or code, commit and push them:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "commit message"
     git push origin feature/your-branch-name
     ```
   - Consider opening a pull request (PR) for your contributions so they can be reviewed and merged.
